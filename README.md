# Rhiz-Tag

Generate a Ubiquitous General Purpose Tag to use in your notes, zettelkasten,
field research or archival project (photos, drafts, scrapbooking). Use it as a
date-identifier for your note's header or as a reference. You can use it between
media: Digital, typewritten, or handwritten. Reference a note in a book, in a
paper, or in your source- code. Everything with the same tag is connected.

The tag contains a date, based on base54: The first letter is the year,
beginning from 2024, the second letter is the week of the year using ISO weeks.
The third letter is a 52nd of a week. It's primarily meant to give the tags an
order, but if you use the tags daily, you learn to read them.

Example: aQu-TWr (a: year 2024, Q: week 39, u: tick 19)
